#### Jerry

**This is a very cloudy day.**

**My elder cousin**

**call me to**

**present a meeting.**

**I pitily ask**

**my friend whether I**

**can or not**

**tour later**

**because of**

**immature time arrangement.**

**As she permitted**

**I begged**

**elder cousin to**

**attend the meeting**

**for me.**

**What a pitty**

**a lot of thing**

**can't be together**

**done in the**

**very same day...**
